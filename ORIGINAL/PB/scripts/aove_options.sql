The relatively low-alcohol beer of that time was preferred as a sanitary option to available drinking water. What are now traditional, artisanal brewing methods evolved, under abbey supervision, during the next seven centuries. The Trappist monasteries that now brew beer in Belgium were occupied in the late 18th century primarily by monks fleeing the French Revolution. However, the first Trappist brewery in Belgium (Westmalle) did not start operation until 10 December 1836, almost 50 years after the Revolution. </p>\r\n    </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>', 1),

Flavouring beer with hops was only gradually adopted because of difficulties in establishing the right proportions of ingredients. Before that, gruit, a mix of various herbs had been used, but did not have the same conserving properties as hops. </p>\r\n    </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>', 1),
